# 🖼️ Image Classification with CNNs

A beginner-friendly project to build a deep learning model for image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This repository demonstrates how to classify images into predefined categories, using popular datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10.

## 🚀 Features
- **End-to-End Workflow**: Data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and testing.
- **Custom CNN Architecture**: Build a simple yet effective CNN from scratch.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhance the dataset with techniques like flipping, rotation, and normalization.
- **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tune pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet for improved performance.
- **Visualization Tools**: Visualize model performance with accuracy and loss plots, as well as misclassified examples.
